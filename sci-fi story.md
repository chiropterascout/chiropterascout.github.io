## some notes:

* it all centres around a dangerous and unstable way to travel faster than light that can only be operated if you're a: half-robot and b: high.
* the protagonists are from a society that lives in giant space stations orbiting black holes, including:
  * a cross-dressing space pirate who impersonates her twin brother (a disgraced space general) to be taken more seriously/feared
  * her twin brother, who sort of blew up a star and never really lived that down, so he's basically a hermit and not super keen that his sister claims to be him but sort of lets it happen cause then he can just chill in a space temple
  * a robot who is also a plant but not really either
  * an investigative journalist that got accidentally caught up in the middle of things and kinda just wants to go home
* the method of traveling faster than light involves diving into an alternate universe/another dimension, it's actually inhabited by weird creatures. they aren't particularly docile and might be sentient.
* as the protagonists flee government spooks, people looking for revenge against the space pirate, people looking for revenge against her brother she impersonates, and the military who want the pirate they think is the general to go back on duty, they have to do a lot of dives and inadvertantly make some dark discoveries about the nature of how that works but can't tell anyone because half the galaxy wants to kill them
* the other half would probably let them
* there's no romantic subplot EVERYONE IS BUSY
